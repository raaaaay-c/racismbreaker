# Racism Breaker

The racist naming on GitHub needs to stop, here's how you can rename your branch from the racist term master which hurts black people to the much nicer and and less charged word: main!

```bash
git branch -m master main
git push -u origin main
```

It's really that easy, racism is no more thanks to us awesome woke javascript software engineers!

If you feel like going the extra mile for extra credit, go to your favorite open source project and tell them to do the same.

Open an issue if they fail to comply and we'll keep work towards publishing this list of the racist developers and organizations that refuse to change!
